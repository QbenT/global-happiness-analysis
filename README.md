# Global Happiness Analysis
## Project Overview
This project explores global happiness data from 156 countries, derived from the World Happiness Report (2015–2019). The goal is to uncover key drivers of happiness, identify regional disparities, and provide actionable insights to policymakers and organizations. By addressing the factors that contribute to happiness—such as GDP, social support, health, freedom, and institutional trust—this analysis supports data-driven strategies for improving global well-being.

Through visualizations and analysis, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of how economic, social, and institutional factors influence happiness worldwide.

## Key Questions
The analysis addresses the following critical questions:

- What drives happiness globally? How do factors like GDP, family support, health, freedom, trust, and generosity contribute?
- How do happiness levels differ across regions? Which regions perform better, and what drives their scores?
- Temporal Trends: How has happiness changed over time (2015–2019)?
- Regional Disparities: What are the key differences in happiness drivers across developed and developing nations?
- Policy Insights: How can this analysis guide actionable policies to improve well-being globally?
## Data Sources and Disclaimer
The analysis uses publicly available data from the World Happiness Report. The dataset includes survey-based happiness scores and contributing factors for 156 countries over five years (2015–2019).

Data Source: World Happiness Report

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- 01 Project Management: Contains project briefs and documentation.
- 02 Data:
  - Raw Data: Unprocessed datasets.
   - Processed Data: Cleaned and prepared datasets ready for analysis.
- 03 Scripts: Python scripts used for data processing and visualization.
- 04 Analysis: Contains visualizations that help explain insights and trends.
- 05 Deliverables: Final reports, presentations, and recommendations for stakeholders.
## Tools and Libraries
The project uses a combination of Python, Tableau, and other tools for analysis and visualization:

- Python Libraries:
  - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
   - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Visualization:
   - Tableau for interactive dashboards and storytelling.
- Development Environment:
  - Jupyter Notebooks for data processing and analysis.
## Approach
The project follows a structured workflow:

- Data Cleaning: Prepare raw data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, patterns, and regional disparities.
- Visualization: Develop Tableau dashboards to present insights interactively.
- Analysis: Correlate happiness scores with key drivers such as GDP, social support, and freedom.
- Recommendations: Provide actionable insights to improve well-being globally.
## Insights and Recommendations
The analysis revealed several key findings:

- Key Drivers of Happiness: Social support and GDP are the strongest contributors, with significant impact across all regions.
- Regional Disparities: Developed regions (e.g., Western Europe, North America) score consistently higher due to robust economic and social systems, while regions like Sub-Saharan Africa lag due to systemic challenges.
- Stable Trends: Happiness scores have remained relatively stable globally from 2015 to 2019, despite economic and social fluctuations.
- Actionable Policies: Investments in social support, healthcare, and institutional trust are critical for improving happiness in underperforming regions.
- Stakeholders and Expected Outcomes
## The project aims to inform:

Policymakers: Highlight disparities and recommend strategies to improve well-being.
Global Organizations: Provide data-driven insights for targeted interventions.
General Public: Enhance understanding of the factors driving happiness globally.
